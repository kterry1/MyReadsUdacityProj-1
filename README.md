# MyReads Project

I built the functionality as my _MyReads Udacity Project_.

## Get Started

- Run `git clone https://github.com/kterry1/MyReadsUdacityProj-1.git`
- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Functionality

- On the main page, you can choose between whether a book should be on the **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read**, or **Read shelf**. The books can be moved between shelves by clicking on the green dropdown on any book and selecting a different shelf.

- On the bottom right of the main page, there is an `Add Button` button marked with a `+`. Feel free to click this button to be taken to the search page.

- Once on the search page, search through the books with the terms which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work when searching.

- From the search page, you can also add any of the books to the shelves on the main page with the books' green dropdown options.

- On the left of the search input area, there is a back button that can be used to take you to the main page. The browser's back button will also take you to the main page.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
